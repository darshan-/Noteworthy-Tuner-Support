== There are hundreds of tuners for Android; why did you create yet another? ==

All of the tuners I was able to find on Android required the user to
pay in order to remove ads.  I could find no tuner that was both free
and ad free, and I thought the world would be better if one existed.

Similarly, I could find no open-source tuner for Android, and that also
seemed to be something worth correcting.

Finally, I thought it would be a fun side project when I was
procrastinating from my schoolwork.  It was!

== Do you use any third-party code in the app? ==

Yes, I use the excellent audio library
[https://github.com/JorenSix/TarsosDSP/ TarsosDSP] to do the heavy
lifting of determining a dominant frequency from raw audio data
captured by the microphone.
